    "# Q1. Pearson Correlation Coefficient:\n",
    "Suppose you have the following data on the amount of time students spend studying for an exam (in hours) and their final exam scores (out of 100):\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Sample data\n",
    "study_time = [10, 20, 15, 25, 30]\n",
    "exam_scores = [60, 75, 70, 85, 90]\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient\n",
    "pearson_corr = np.corrcoef(study_time, exam_scores)[0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Pearson Correlation Coefficient: {pearson_corr:.2f}\")\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Pearson correlation coefficient is close to 1, it indicates a strong positive linear relationship between study time and exam scores.\n",
    "If it is close to -1, it indicates a strong negative linear relationship.\n",
    "If it is close to 0, it suggests a weak or no linear relationship.\n",
    " # Q2. Spearman's Rank Correlation:\n",
    "Suppose you have the following data on the amount of sleep individuals get each night and their overall job satisfaction level on a scale of 1 to 10:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "import scipy.stats as stats\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Sample data\n",
    "sleep_duration = [7, 8, 6, 5, 8]\n",

    "\n",
    "print(f\"Spearman's Rank Correlation: {spearman_corr:.2f}\")\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "A positive Spearman's rank correlation suggests a monotonic increase (or decrease) in job satisfaction with an increase in sleep duration.\n",
    "A negative value indicates a monotonic decrease.\n",
    "A value close to 0 implies a weak or no monotonic relationship.\n",
    "# Q3. Comparison of Pearson and Spearman:\n",
    "Suppose you have data on the number of hours of exercise per week and body mass index (BMI) for 50 participants:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "     # Assume you have the data in the variables exercise_hours and bmi\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient\n",
    "pearson_corr_exercise_bmi = np.corrcoef(exercise_hours, bmi)[0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Calculate Spearman's rank correlation\n",
    "spearman_corr_exercise_bmi, _ = stats.spearmanr(exercise_hours, bmi)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Pearson Correlation: {pearson_corr_exercise_bmi:.2f}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Spearman's Rank Correlation: {spearman_corr_exercise_bmi:.2f}\")\n",
    "Comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pearson measures linear relationships, while Spearman captures monotonic relationships.\n",
    "If the relationship is strictly linear, Pearson and Spearman will provide similar results.\n",
    "If the relationship is non-linear, Spearman might capture it better.\n",
    "# Q4. Pearson Correlation for TV Watching and Physical Activity:\n",
    "Suppose you have data on the number of hours individuals spend watching television per day and their level of physical activity:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "    # Assume you have the data in the variables tv_hours and physical_activity\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient\n",
    "pearson_corr_tv_activity = np.corrcoef(tv_hours, physical_activity)[0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Pearson Correlation Coefficient: {pearson_corr_tv_activity:.2f}\")\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "A positive correlation suggests that individuals who watch more TV tend to have lower levels of physical activity.\n",
    "A negative correlation suggests the opposite.\n",
    "#  Q5. Soft Drink Preference by Age:\n",
    "The data seems incomplete. Assuming age is associated with each soft drink preference:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "     # Sample data\n",
    "age_soft_drink = [(25, 'Coke'), (42, 'Pepsi'), (37, 'Mountain Dew'), (19, 'Coke'), (31, 'Pepsi'), (28, 'Coke')]\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Convert to separate lists for age and soft drink preference\n",
    "age, soft_drink = zip(*age_soft_drink)\n",

    "    # Convert soft drink preferences to numerical values\n",
    "soft_drink_mapping = {'Coke': 1, 'Pepsi': 2, 'Mountain Dew': 3}\n",
    "soft_drink_numerical = [soft_drink_mapping[s] for s in soft_drink]\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient\n",
    "pearson_corr_age_soft_drink = np.corrcoef(age, soft_drink_numerical)[0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Pearson Correlation Coefficient: {pearson_corr_age_soft_drink:.2f}\")\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation coefficient indicates the strength and direction of the linear relationship between age and soft drink preferences.\n",
    "Positive values suggest a positive linear relationship, while negative values suggest a negative linear relationship.\n",
